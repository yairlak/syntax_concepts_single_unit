PTB-INFO: There are still 15 textures, offscreen windows or proxy windows open. Screen('CloseAll') will auto-close them.
PTB-INFO: This may be fine for studies where you only use a few textures or windows, but a large number of open
PTB-INFO: textures or offscreen windows can be an indication that you forgot to dispose no longer needed items
PTB-INFO: via a proper call to Screen('Close', [windowOrTextureIndex]); , e.g., at the end of each trial. These
PTB-INFO: stale objects linger around and can consume significant memory ressources, causing degraded performance,
PTB-INFO: timing trouble (if the system has to resort to disk paging) and ultimately out of memory conditions or
PTB-INFO: crashes. Please check your code. (Screen('Close') is a quick way to release all textures and offscreen windows)



INFO: PTB's Screen('Flip', 10) command seems to have missed the requested stimulus presentation deadline
INFO: a total of 27 times out of a total of 42 flips during this session.

INFO: This number is fairly accurate (and indicative of real timing problems in your own code or your system)
INFO: if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
INFO: If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator
INFO: of timing behaviour than a hard reliable measurement. Large numbers may indicate problems and should at least
INFO: deserve your closer attention. Cfe. 'help SyncTrouble', the FAQ section at www.psychtoolbox.org and the
INFO: examples in the PDF presentation in PsychDocumentation/Psychtoolbox3-Slides.pdf for more info and timing tips.



WARNING: This session of your experiment was run by you with the setting Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 2).
WARNING: This means that some internal self-tests and calibrations were skipped. Your stimulus presentation timing
WARNING: may have been wrong. This is fine for development and debugging of your experiment, but for running the real
WARNING: study, please make sure to set Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 0) for maximum accuracy and reliability.

PTB-INFO: This is Psychtoolbox-3 for Apple OS X, under Matlab 64-Bit (Version 3.0.17 - Build date: Apr 18 2021).
PTB-INFO: OS support status: OSX version 10.14 is no longer tested or officially supported at all for this Psychtoolbox release.

PTB-INFO: Installation of the PsychtoolboxKernelDriver is strongly recommended if you care about precise visual
PTB-INFO: onset timestamping or timing. See 'help PsychtoolboxKernelDriver' for installation instructions.


PTB-INFO: OpenGL-Renderer is ATI Technologies Inc. :: AMD Radeon Pro 555X OpenGL Engine :: 2.1 ATI-2.9.26
PTB-INFO: Renderer has 4096 MB of VRAM and a maximum 3843 MB of texture memory.
PTB-INFO: VBL startline = 2100 , VBL Endline = -1
PTB-INFO: Beamposition queries unsupported or defective on this system. Using basic timestamping as fallback.
PTB-INFO: Timestamps returned by Screen('Flip') will be therefore less robust and accurate.
PTB-INFO: Measured monitor refresh interval from VBLsync = 0.000000 ms [inf Hz]. (0 valid samples taken, stddev=0.000000 ms.)
PTB-INFO: Small deviations between reported values are normal and no reason to worry.
PTB-WARNING: ==================================================================================================================
PTB-WARNING: DESKTOP COMPOSITOR IS ACTIVE! ALL FLIP STIMULUS ONSET TIMESTAMPS WILL BE VERY LIKELY UNRELIABLE AND LESS ACCURATE!
PTB-WARNING: STIMULUS ONSET TIMING WILL BE UNRELIABLE AS WELL, AND GRAPHICS PERFORMANCE MAY BE REDUCED!
PTB-WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS MODE FOR RUNNING REAL EXPERIMENT SESSIONS WITH ANY REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCURATE TIMING!
PTB-WARNING: ==================================================================================================================
PTB-INFO: All display tests and calibrations disabled. Assuming a refresh interval of 60.000000 Hz. Timing will be inaccurate!
PTB-INFO: Psychtoolbox imaging pipeline starting up for window with requested imagingmode 33793 ...
PTB-INFO: Will use 8 bits per color component framebuffer for stimulus drawing.
PTB-INFO: Enabling panel fitter. Providing virtual framebuffer of 1680 x 1050 pixels size.
PTB-INFO: Will use 8 bits per color component framebuffer for stimulus post-processing (if any).
